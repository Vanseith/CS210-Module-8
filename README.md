Project Summary: Corner Grocer requesting a program that parse through daily text records generated. Program prompts a menu where user can either 1) receive frequency of specific word,
2) print list with numbers that represent frequency of all items in records, 3) print in the form of a histogram, and 4) exit the program.

The program does a particularly good job in utilizing linked lists to map unique items to their frequencies. The program also displays some input validation.

Program can be enhanced by including exception handling and combining menu options 2 and 3 in the same function.

The most challenging part was getting used to linked list access and mutation. Making sure user input matches the keys in such linked list required a bit of string modification.

The main transferrable skill from this project will mainly be file handling and OOP techniques.

The program was made readable by splitting the program functionality into multiple functions. The program is fairly maintainable through using in-text comments for external viewing.
The program is adaptable as it prompts the user for a specific file name and not any generic file.
